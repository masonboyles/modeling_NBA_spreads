# modeling_NBA_spreads

This project was initially done in R, and then I adapted it with some modifications to use Python libraries.

## Project2Data 
- Contains all modeling
- 2 Linear models, ridge regression, decision trees, random forests, Poisson
- compared the performance

## Predictions.csv
- Predicted spread of real NBA games in the future
- Predicted with an MAE of 12.47

## final_project.ipynb
- Modeling adapted to Python
- neural network, linear model, ridge regression, decision trees, random forest models

## predicting_nba_spreads_using_various_models.pdf
- Paper summarizing work done in Python
- Pay special attention to the section on "Data Collection and Manipulation" and further
